# Hot Hand Phenomenon in Basketball_A Bayesian Analysis
 The "hot hand" phenomenon in basketball is the belief that a player is more likely to make a shot after making previous shots. This project aims to determine if this phenomenon truly exists or if it occurs only due to pure chance (e.g., law of large numbers). Shot level data from the 2015-16 NBA season was analyzed and player-specific probabilities of making a shot when "hot" (defined as making the last n shots) versus "not hot" (making less than the last \( n \) shots). The models in this project were created using PyMC, and the posterior distributions were assessed to understand the credibility of the hot-hand effect.
